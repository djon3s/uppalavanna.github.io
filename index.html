    <h1>Uppalavannarama Bhikkhunupassaya: A Bhikkhuni Residence in Harris Park, Sydney</h1>
    <h2>About Uppalavannarama</h2>

<p>Uppalavannarama Bhikkhunupassaya Kappiya Association was founded in 2023 out of the intention of individuals in the Sydney Buddhist lay community to support an urban bhikkhuni residence for the practice and study of early Buddhism. The association operates under the guidance of Ayya Suvira.

The association assists bhikkhunis, sikkhamanas and samaneris by providing a rented residence in Harris Park (Uppalavannarama or UBU), and material support to invited monastics.</p>


    <h2>About Ayya Suvira</h2>

<p>Ayya Suvira received novice ordination in 2016, and full ordination as a bhikkhuni in 2019 with Ayya Santini Mahatheri of Indonesia as preceptor. Bhante Sujato is her mentor.

Ayya Suvira is secretary of the Australian Sangha Association, a national peak body representing Buddhist monks and nuns in Australia. She also represents the Australian Sangha Association on the advisory groups of Cemeteries and Crematoria NSW, Catholic Cemeteries and Crematoria, and OneCrown.</p> 

    <h2>Practice</h2>

<p>The primary source of teaching and practice at Uppalavannarama is the text of the Pali suttas and vinaya, which record the words of the Buddha, which we live in the local context. As a “hermit-at-heart,” Ayya Suvira’s dream is to eventually be able to use the bhikkhuni residence to support a higher level of meditation practice in seclusion, with few external commitments, as per the model of the Buddha’s disciples, Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila in the Upakilesa Sutta in MN128.</p> 

<p>Ayya Suvira encourages all people to sincerely practice meritorious deeds and the ten wholesome dhammas; and to learn, practice and transmit Buddhism widely for the purpose of liberation.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>Our practice as bhikkhunis includes the intention of harmlessness. In recent years, this has meant giving a higher priority to the environment in our daily lives and actively resisting harmful trends in the broader society.</p>

<p>Ayya Suvira wishes that the monastery can support the ongoing transmission of environmentally friendly Buddhist material culture. In accordance with traditional Buddhist practices, we manufacture various small items, such as plastic-free palm-fibre toothwood, for our own use.</p>

<p>Further, we have replaced toxic synthetic dyes with sustainably harvested mangrove tannin dyes from Indonesia.</p>

<p>Ayya wishes that the wider community can join us to reduce plastics at this time of environmental need. </p>
