About Uppalavannarama

Uppalavannarama Bhikkhunupassaya Kappiya Association was founded in 2023 out of the intention of individuals in the Sydney Buddhist lay community to support an urban bhikkhuni residence for the practice and study of early Buddhism. The association operates under the guidance of Ayya Suvira.

The association assists bhikkhunis, sikkhamanas and samaneris by providing a rented residence in Harris Park (Uppalavannarama or UBU), and material support to invited monastics.

About Ayya Suvira

Ayya Suvira received novice ordination in 2016, and full ordination as a bhikkhuni in 2019 with Ayya Santini Mahatheri of Indonesia as preceptor. Bhante Sujato is her mentor.

Ayya Suvira is currently secretary of the Australian Sangha Association, a national peak body representing Buddhist monks and nuns in Australia. She also represents the Australian Sangha Association on the advisory groups of Cemeteries and Crematoria NSW, Catholic Cemeteries and Crematoria, and OneCrown. 

Practice

The primary source of teaching and practice at Uppalavannarama is the text of the Pali suttas and vinaya, which record the words of the Buddha. As a “hermit-at-heart,” Ayya Suvira’s dream is to eventually be able to use the bhikkhuni residence to support a higher level of meditation practice in seclusion, with few external commitments, as per the model of the Buddha’s disciples, Venerables Anuruddha, Nandiya and Kimbila in the Upakilesa Sutta in MN128. 

Ayya Suvira encourages all people to sincerely practice meritorious deeds and the ten wholesome dhammas; and to learn, practice and transmit Buddhism widely for the purpose of liberation.
